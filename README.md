# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction in Indian Cities

## Overview
Air pollution is a growing crisis in India, affecting public health and the economy. This project aims to analyze air pollution levels across six major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai. The dataset includes hourly air quality measurements from 2019 to 2023, enabling us to study pollutant trends, seasonal variations, and their impact on the Air Quality Index (AQI).

## Problem Statement
All of Indiaâ€™s 1.4 billion people are exposed to unhealthy levels of harmful pollutants from multiple sources. This project aims to:
- Analyze and understand major air pollutants and AQI trends.
- Identify patterns that provide data-backed insights.
- Develop a system to alert citizens about air quality levels and recommend protective measures.
